                    <p>Hi, looking for Junior Cert notes? Well you have come to the right place, for most of it anyways.
                       I'm a Junior Cert student and hate reading notes from an old crinkled copy so I decided to type up notes.
                       Then however I could only use them when I logged into onedrive which took forever. I decided to make a 
                       website for notes so I could view them anywhere, anytime.
                    </p>
                    <p>I'm trying to make notes out for the site as quick as I can but theres homework to consider and the rest of life.
                       I'll to try and keep adding notes but between making notes, adding to the website, and just about everyhting else,
                       I don't have the time.
                    </p>
                    <p>Hoefully my notes will help someone out some day! Goodluck!</p>
